# Tokenization Platform Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our tokenization platform, detailing the logic behind tokenization, the valuation process, and the classification of companies into different classes.

## Tokenization Logic

### 1. Company Onboarding

Companies undergo a seamless onboarding process, which includes registration, due diligence, and the collection of necessary documentation. This ensures that only legitimate and compliant companies participate in the tokenization platform.

### 2. Valuation

#### 2.1 Financial Assessment

Upon successful onboarding, a rigorous financial assessment is conducted. This involves a thorough examination of the company's financials using established valuation methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, comparable company analysis, and third-party audits.

#### 2.2 Tokenization Decision

Based on the company's valuation, a decision is made on the percentage of ownership to be tokenized. For example, a company valued at $10 million may decide to tokenize 20%, resulting in a tokenization value of $2 million.

### 3. Tokenization Process

#### 3.1 Token Standards

The platform supports industry-standard token standards such as ERC-20. This ensures compatibility with existing blockchain ecosystems and facilitates the smooth integration of tokens.

#### 3.2 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are developed to govern the tokenization process. These contracts dictate rules for token issuance, transfer, and compliance, providing transparency and security throughout the lifecycle of the tokens.

### 4. Token Issuance

#### 4.1 Nominal Value

The platform determines a nominal value for each token. This can be a fixed amount or a fraction of the company's valuation. For instance, if 2 million tokens are issued for a $2 million valuation, each token has a nominal value of $1.

#### 4.2 Token Distribution

Tokens are issued to the company's digital wallet on the blockchain. The company then distributes these tokens to investors based on their contributions during fundraising campaigns.

### 5. Investor Onboarding

Investors register on the platform, complete Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, and set up digital wallets to receive the tokens.

### 6. Fundraising Campaign

Companies create fundraising campaigns on the platform, specifying the amount to be raised and the percentage of ownership tokens offered. Investors contribute funds, and upon reaching the fundraising goal, ownership tokens are automatically allocated to their wallets.

### 7. Secondary Market (Optional)

The platform supports a secondary market where investors can trade ownership tokens, providing liquidity and flexibility in the market.

### 8. Dividend Distribution

If the company generates profits, smart contracts automatically distribute dividends to token holders based on their ownership percentage.

### 9. Monitoring and Reporting

The platform provides real-time updates on the company's performance, financial reports, and changes in ownership. Investors can access transparent and immutable records on the blockchain.

## Valuation and Company Classes

### 1. Valuation-Based Classes

To cater to companies of varying sizes, we introduce a classification system based on valuation.

#### 1.1 Class A (Small Companies)

- Valuation Range: $1 million to $5 million
- Predefined Token Allocation: e.g., 1 million tokens

#### 1.2 Class B (Medium Companies)

- Valuation Range: $5 million to $20 million
- Predefined Token Allocation: e.g., 5 million tokens

#### 1.3 Class C (Large Companies)

- Valuation Range: $20 million to $50 million
- Predefined Token Allocation: e.g., 10 million tokens

#### 1.4 Class D (Very Large Companies)

- Valuation Range: $50 million and above
- Predefined Token Allocation: e.g., 20 million tokens

### 2. Flexibility within Classes

Companies within each class have some flexibility in choosing the exact number of tokens, allowing for customization based on their specific valuation and fundraising needs.

### 3. Guidance for Companies

Guidance is provided to companies on which class might be most suitable based on their valuations, ensuring a streamlined tokenization process.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive documentation outlines the intricate details of our tokenization platform, covering the logic behind tokenization, the valuation process, and the introduction of company classes. Further refinement and development will be based on market feedback and evolving industry standards.
