# Quillo - Tokenizing Company Shares on the ICP Blockchain

Quillo is a platform designed to tokenize company shares using the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain. It leverages the Rust CDK for smart contract development and React.js for the user interface. The platform allows companies to onboard, undergo valuation using Discounted Cash Flow and Multiple of earnings algorithms to tokenize a portion of their shares, and facilitate trading of these tokens on the blockchain.
